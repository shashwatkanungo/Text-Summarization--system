# Text-Summarization--system


This project is focused on building a robust text summarization tool that automatically condenses large volumes of text into concise and informative summaries. The tool leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including transformer-based models, to understand and extract the most important information from a given text. The goal is to provide summaries that are not only shorter but also retain the key points and original intent of the source material.

*Features*

Extractive Summarization: Identifies and extracts key sentences from the original text, creating a summary that is a subset of the input.

Abstractive Summarization: Generates summaries by paraphrasing and rephrasing the content, aiming to create a coherent and fluent output that may include novel words and phrases not present in the original text.

Customizable Length: Allows users to specify the desired length of the summary.

Multi-language Support: Capable of processing text in multiple languages (depending on the model used).

Easy Integration: Can be easily integrated into applications via RESTful API or used as a standalone script.
